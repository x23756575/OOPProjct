                + "of the total pollution in the oceans. Plastic materials, such as bottles, bags, and microplastics, not only harm marine life but also "
                + "pose serious risks to human health as they enter the food chain.\n\n"
                + "Another significant pollutant is oil, which is often discharged into the ocean from ships, drilling rigs, or during oil transportation. "
                + "Even small amounts of oil can cause extensive damage to marine ecosystems, coating the feathers of birds and the fur of mammals, "
                + "as well as harming fish and other marine species.\n\n"

                + "regulate shipping and industrial discharges, and promote clean-up initiatives. The restoration of marine ecosystems is also critical, "
                + "as healthy oceans provide essential resources such as food, oxygen, and regulate the planet's climate.";

                + "When water temperatures rise, corals expel the algae that live inside their tissues, which gives them their color. Without algae, corals "
                + "lose their vibrant hues and become vulnerable to disease and death.\n\n"
                + "Additionally, warmer oceans are contributing to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which leads to rising sea levels. "
                + "This can cause coastal erosion, threaten coastal communities, and result in the loss of habitat for marine species.\n\n"
                + "Ocean warming also affects fish populations, many of which are sensitive to changes in temperature. Warmer waters can alter migration patterns "
                + "and disrupt food chains, leading to a decline in fish stocks.\n\n"
                + "The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, is another consequence of ocean warming. "
                + "These storms gain strength from warm ocean waters and can lead to severe flooding and damage to coastal regions.";
